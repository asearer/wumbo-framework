# Wumbo Core Package
# This __init__.py file marks the 'core' directory as a Python package.
# It can be used to expose key classes or functions from core modules if desired.

# Example: from .base import BaseClass
# Example: from .registry import Registry

# For now, this file is intentionally left minimal.
